    title: "What is a Flywheel?",
    content: "A flywheel stores rotational energy and helps maintain smooth, steady motion in machines.",
    fun: "The idea of flywheels dates back to ancient potter’s wheels over 5,000 years ago!"

    title: "Moment of Inertia",
    content: "It's how much an object resists changes in rotation. Higher when mass is farther from the center.",
    fun: "Figure skaters increase spin speed by pulling their arms in. They reduce their moment of inertia!"

  {
    title: "Angular Speed",
    content: "Angular speed is how fast something spins, measured in radians per second (rad/s).",
    fun: "The Earth rotates at about 7.29 × 10⁻⁵ rad/s and that’s one rotation every 24 hours!"

    title: "Formula 1 KERS System",
    content: "F1 cars used flywheels to store braking energy and boost speed during acceleration.",
    fun: "KERS could give F1 cars an extra 80 horsepower for about 6.6 seconds per lap!"
